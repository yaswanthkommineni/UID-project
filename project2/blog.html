            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                I was born in Thullur, Andhra pradesh,India. I completed my schooling in Sri chaitanya Techno school in Lakshmipuram, Guntur and completed the Class XII from sri chaitanya jr.college, Guntur.
                Currently I am studying in Amrita school of engineering, Kerala (2019-2023). I have a sweet sister (Likhitha Lavanya Kommineni) who is currently working at TCS.
                
                Coming to my academics, I did well in X board examination as I passed out with 10 GPA, but things were harder in secondary schooling due to my addiction to PUBG,
                although I managed to do well in XII board examination but I struggled to score in JEE and other entrance examinations.</p>
            
            <p>
                I am a very happy person. I don't expect much from the life and I love the process more than the result. 
                Some of the ways I enjoy to pass my time are drawing pencil sketches, talking to friends, learning something interesting, playing sports like cricket and badminton and watching movies (all languages).
            </p>
            <p>
                My personality took a lot of turns after I've joined the Amrita University. During the first year, I haven't socialized much and spent most of my time in my room streaming on OTTs.
                Before COVID-19, I've got exposed to a field called competitive programming by Dr. Swaminathan (senior faculty at Amrita School of Engineering) and Mayank Pugalia (my senior).
                That introduction to CP was a crucial moment in my college because during the next 2 years (in lockdown), I went on to become a master at it.
                It's not like I'm obsessed with it but because of happiness I get from solving puzzles made me spend a lot of time in it.
                In 2022 February, I've got a call from my college to continue my academics offline. I beleive this one of the most important phases in my life.
                My philosophy foundations got rechecked and my meaning of happiness got changed. Those 3 months were the most energetic since my 10th standard.
                I believe my friends (mosty one person) are the reason behind my new socialization.
            </p>
            
            <h2>How to achieve success in Competitive Programming </h2>
            <p>
                The question people ask me frequently is how I became a Master (>2100 rating) in Codeforces. My answer is not going to be practice. Because, I believe practice alone is not sufficient as 
                I came across enough programmers to tell that. The main thing we need in this field is resistance. You need practice for sure, but the resistance plays a key role here.
                See, this field is highly competitive. Whatever level you may reach, there's always more you can do. It's never ending. You have to choose where to stop. 
                You should put continous effort to improve yourself. In this field, we encounter many obstacles and we need a lot of time and patience to clear those. 
                When you encounter a bug, you should be patient enough to debug. many just give up and move on and that's a very very bad thing to do because most probably 
                you'll encounter the same in the future if you decide to stay in CP and improve yourself. Going beyond your comfort zone is really important. If you try a harder
                problem, you try to solve it with maximum concentration. There is a breaking point where we give up on the problem. If you don't have resistance, you give up easily and gain nothing.
                If you have enough resistance and skill, you'll solve the problem. Even if you did not solve that problem, your thinking capability and approaching a solution gets better.
                It's not at all a waste of time. According to my exeprience, it's definitely better than staying in your comfort zone and solving the problems that you're comfortable with.
                It's necessary to mention that spending too much time on a single problem may not be a good strategy. Learning things is not a tough part in this field.
                But, applying right techniques is the key.
